# vscode-clipboard-with-formatter

Optimize your copy and paste.Keep a history of your copied items and re-paste if needed. What's more? it can format your copied code segment.

## Features

As we can see on VSCode marketplace, there are some extensions on clipboard. But I haven't seen a clipboard with formatter features.
If we try to rewrite some project, several past variables & class & function were useful. After we copied them, the details about them
became mistery. That's why I code this.


**Enjoy!**
